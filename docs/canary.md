# Using Arc canary build
To use the latest pre-release updates of Arc you will need to clone this [repository](https://github.com/arcjs/arcjs).

`cd` into the `arcjs/` directory and run `npm install`. You will want to build the `master` branch by running `npm run build`. Arc will be compiled into the `/lib` directory.

You can link your project to Arc using [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link).
